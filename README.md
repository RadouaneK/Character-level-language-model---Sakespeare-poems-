love to deep

can make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.

but since your worth (wide as the ocean is)

the humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
my saucy bark (inferior far to his)
on your broad main doth wilfully appear.
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
or (being wrecked) i am a worthless boat,
he of tall building, and of goodly pride.
